If you are wondering how to change it because you do not know much javascript, this may help.


How to change size / looks:

pts = [[0,0],[1,0.5],[0,1]]; // points for polygon a1
a1 = polygon(pts); // letter A in its entirety
a12 = extrudeShape(a1,0.1).display(); // extruding polygon a1 and displaying (you can control thickness)

Keep in mind that if it is negative for the 1st parameter, it means go down.
If it is negative for the 2nd parameter, it means go left.
